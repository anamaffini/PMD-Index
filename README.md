# PMD Index

**PMD Index** is a plugin for calculating a set of urban network metrics in QGIS that was developed by [Ana Luisa Maffini](https://github.com/anamaffini) and [Gustavo Maciel Gonçalves](https://github.com/gustavo-m-goncalves) in the [Urban Systems Research Group](https://www.ufrgs.br/sistemas-urbanos/en/) at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS) in Brazil.\
The PMD metrics are based on the configurational model of Polarity conceived by professor [Romulo Krafta](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Romulo-Krafta).

**Potential Movement** is the frequency with which streets in the urban street network belong to the shortest paths of a population when heading to urban facilities, which can be taken as an indicator of population flows.

The PMD Index plugin considers origins and destinations locations to estimate potential movements. It also uses weights according to the size (i.e.: attractiveness, magnitude) of destination locations and the size of origin locations (i.e.: number of people or households). 

The plugin is written in Python, and it's algorithm was developed by [Ana Luisa Maffini](https://github.com/anamaffini) at Chalmers University during her time as a visitor PhD researcher, and it is based on the script GAUS, developed by [Guilherme Dalcin](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Guilherme-Dalcin) in the [Urban Systems Research Group](https://www.ufrgs.br/sistemas-urbanos/en/).

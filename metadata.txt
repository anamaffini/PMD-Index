about = PMD Index is a set of urban network metrics that consider urban space as a network graph for its calculation. Potential Movement is the frequency with which streets in the urban street network belong to the shortest paths of a population when heading to urban facilities, which can be taken as an indicator of population flows. The PMD Index considers origins and destinations to estimate potential movements. It also uses weights according to the size (or attractiveness) of destination locations and the size of origin locations (number of people or households).
